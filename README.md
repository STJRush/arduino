For arduino code

The current project is to make some very low power sensors that can be placed around the community to measure things like soil moisture levels in green houses in Rush, weather data and perhalps some flooding data.

We would like to build a large network of very low power sensors in Rush using a technology called LoRa. These don't need WiFi and instead use radio to send data. The sensors can be small due to their low power. Each sensor will be a node and nodes will connect to a LoRa gateway (a Rpi on a network) to connect to the Things Network.
